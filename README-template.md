## Overview

## My process

Firstly I had to make the box-sizing of all elements the border-box value then I went ahead as removing the paddings and margins of the whole body to avoid obstructions while working then as you saw in the Image I changed the background color of the body, I made a container which housed the qr-code aswell as the texts, I was able to centralise everything and as you have seen it came out great, However i didn't find it a challenge it still thought of it as fun.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries


### What I learned

Really did't learn anything from this project but it did help me put in what I've learn't into practice because now I was able to use the justify-content css property into work which was how I was able to centralise all the objects. 



### Continued development

The flex-box principle in css along with grid is still a topic I am not fully accustomed with but I am confident that with time as I focus on more challenges involving the use of these principle I shall no doubt become a master in this field.
